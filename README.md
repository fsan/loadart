# LOADART
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fsan/loadart.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fsan/loadart)

It is just a simple package that may load artifacts, verify hash and extract to certain folder.
Although very simple, this seems to me a very simple task I keep doing over and over again in my
personal projects.

## How to use

1. Create a .json file with the artifacts necessary for your project
1. Create (or use the sample python script) that creates the manager and download
1. It will store (if you choose) a pkl file with information regarding the artifacts.
